# MPlayer
MPlayer for FunKey-S

Check the "funkey" branch for the FunKey-S changes and build. Otherwise, check the MPlayer directory to see the original source and its corresponding README.

If you want to build MPlayer from source to use your own binary with the build process, use the FunKey-SDK (https://github.com/FunKey-Project/FunKey-OS/releases) and --target=arm-funkey-linux during the ./configure process before building.
