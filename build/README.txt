MPlayer port for Funkey-S by NovemberJoy

Big thanks to gameblabla, the FunKey team, and gnarface from the mplayer IRC. Without them, this port might not have happened.

Accepted filetypes are .avi, .mpeg, .mp4, .mkv, .webm, and .mov. Resolutions above 240x240 will play, but overly high resolutions may cause performance problems.

Controls:

A - Play/Pause
B - Toggle on-screen display
X/Y - Increase/Decrease font size for subtitles
Up/Down - Increase/Decrease volume
Fn+Down - Fit video to screen with 1:1 ratio
Fn+R/Fn+L - Increase/Decrease playback speed
Left+Right - Seek forward and backwards. Hold Fn to seek more.
Menu - Exit MPlayer
